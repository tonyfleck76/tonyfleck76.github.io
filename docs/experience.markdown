### Clinetic - Software Engineer
#### March 2021 - Current

Clinetic is a health software and technology company that utilizes electronic health record systems for research, evidence generation, and new care delivery models.

- Migrated all microservices from Scala and Finatra to Java 17 and Spring, reducing boilerplate code and simplifying future development
- Built a test framework for Elasticsearch and Mongodb, allowing developers to load the starting state with any data needed with tests, and compare the expected state of the data store to the actual state of the data store
- Led the integration of test containers into microservices, allowing full end to end tests using the same infrastructure as live environments, and leading to fewer bugs and increased confidence in releases
- Built a query engine capable of defining complex queries on electronic health records and identifying patients that fit into a study, skipping the manual task of combing records for these patients, all without the data leaving the healthcare system's network
- Built a reporting engine capable of reading and querying data from a distributed set of installations at various healthcare systems, and then performing aggregations and calculations on that data, in order to let study sponsors see their data in real time
- Built a seamless experience between a cloud based web app and a web app that is deployed on premise at various health systems, allowing users to work with reporting data in the cloud but work with patient data in the same app without data leaving the healthcare system's network
