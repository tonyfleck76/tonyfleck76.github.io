I am convinced that in my life time, I have seen my favorite teams lose more than win, when I actively attend or watch games. Rather than believe the likely explanation that my favorite teams simply underperform, I've chosen to spend many hours
tracking the Cubs games I watch and seeing how the numbers stack up throughout the 2023 season. This naturally spiraled into comparing not just wins and losses, but also the stats of individual players.

These stats are current as of April 24th, 2023. (And hopefully this will be automated in the near future.)

### Win Rate

| Overall Wins | Overall Losses | Wins I've watched | Losses I've Watched | Overall Win Rate | Win Rate for games I've watched |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| 12 | 9 | 5 | 1 | 0.55 | 0.83 |

### Batting Averages

Below are players who have a difference of at least one standard deviation from their seasonal batting average in the games I've watched.

| Player Name | Overall At Bats | Overall Hits | At Bats I've Watched | Hits I've Watched | Overall Batting Avg | Batting Avg When I Watch |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Yan Gomes | 51 | 13 | 21 | 3 | 0.255 | 0.143 |
| Nico Hoerner | 93 | 33 | 28 | 13 | 0.293 | 0.464 |
| Nick Madrigal | 41 | 12 | 4 | 2 | 0.355 | 0.500 |
