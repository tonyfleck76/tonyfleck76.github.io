### Data Analysis

#### For the Home Team

MLB data analytics built in Rust using Polars dataframes and the MLB Stats API.

I am convinced that in my life time, I have seen my favorite teams lose more than win, when I actively attend or watch games. Rather than believe the likely explanation that my favorite teams simply underperform, I've chosen to spend many hours
tracking the Cubs games I watch and seeing how the numbers stack up throughout the 2023 season. This naturally spiraled into comparing not just wins and losses, but also the stats of individual players. You can follow the progress below.

### Games

#### Asteroids

A fully functional clone of the classic "Asteroids" game built in Rust using the Bevy game engine. Aim with the mouse pointer, and fire lasers with left mouse to see how high your score can get!

I had been looking for a small project to get my feet wet with Rust, and it just so happened that a post about Bevy's 0.10 release came across my feed at the same time. I took this as an opporunity to finally learn a new language, as well as explore the world of game development, which I've always been interested in but haven't had the chance to really dig into. It ended up being a great introduction to Rust and I'm already looking forward to more.
