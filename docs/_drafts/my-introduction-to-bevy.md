title: "My introduction to Rust - Bevy!"
---

For better or for worse, it seems impossible to avoid the Rust hype on the internet these days. Whether you're a fan of the language or not,
you can't deny the buzz that it seems to be creating.

I've actually tried learning Rust a couple times in the past. Once in college, when myself and a classmate attempted to use it for the final project
in our programming languages class. The project was to build our own programming language on top of another, which was a big challenge in and of itself.
You may have assumed this already, but we were in way over our heads. We ended up pivoting and doing the project in C, which in retrospect, was probably
not easier, but was something we were familiar with at least.

Since then I've gone through the guessing game in the rust book at least twice in an attempt to actually learn the language, but each time my eyes would
glaze over somewhere learning about ownership. My brain had too much Java in it, I guess, and I would usually just move on to something else. However, the
announcement of Bevy's 0.10 release came across my feed. Wondering what this was all about, I jumped to the comments to form an opinion.

People seemed genuinely excited about what the Bevy engine was doing. After a little more research, I thought the project looked interesting and wanted to give it
a try. I had messed with LibGDX in Java about a decade ago, and tried to continue that excitement for building games into something more robust like Unreal Engine or Unity,
but for whatever reason those more advanced engines never clicked for me. There's something about doing everything through code that my brain really enjoys (though to clarify,
it is definitely not the most productive way to do things).

After going through a few examples, I was left to my own devices to create an objective. I settled on cloning Asteroids. It fits the bill perfectly. It allowed me to figure out
many of the base pieces of a game (rendering, input, collision, etc) but in a very contained way. With a checklist on my desk, I set to work!
